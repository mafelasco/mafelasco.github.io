## Featured Projects

### London Stone Showrooms
**Commercial | Luxury Stone Showroom Design**

I've had the pleasure of designing multiple showrooms for London Stone, one of the UK's premier natural stone suppliers. These projects required careful consideration of material display, customer flow, and brand representation.

**Key Achievements:**
- Created immersive environments that showcase natural stone products
- Designed flexible display systems for varying product sizes
- Coordinated with builders and installers throughout the project
- Managed budgets and timelines for multiple locations
