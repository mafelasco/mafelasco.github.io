# About Mariana Fernandez

## Bringing Spaces to Life Through Thoughtful Design

I'm Mariana Fernandez, a freelance interior designer with a passion for creating exceptional spaces that perfectly balance beauty, functionality, and commercial viability. With extensive experience in both commercial and residential projects, I specialize in transforming concepts into reality while managing every detail of the design and construction process.

## Professional Experience

### Current Focus: London Stone Showrooms
**Lead Interior Designer**

I currently work with London Stone, designing their luxury showrooms across multiple locations. This role encompasses:

- **Design Development**: Creating immersive environments that showcase natural stone products in their best light
- **Project Management**: Overseeing all aspects of showroom development from initial concept to final installation
- **Builder Coordination**: Working directly with construction teams to ensure designs are executed to the highest standards
- **Material & Cost Management**: Balancing aesthetic goals with practical considerations including budgets, timelines, and material sourcing
- **Layout Optimization**: Designing flexible display systems and customer flow patterns that enhance the shopping experience

### Design Philosophy

My approach to interior design is grounded in three core principles:

**1. Functionality First**  
Every beautiful space must work perfectly for its intended purpose. I start with understanding how people will use the space, then create designs that enhance those experiences.

**2. Material Mastery**  
Understanding materials – their properties, costs, availability, and installation requirements – is crucial for successful projects. This knowledge ensures designs are not only beautiful but also practical and sustainable.

**3. Collaborative Process**  
The best results come from true collaboration with clients, builders, and suppliers. I believe in transparent communication and shared problem-solving throughout every project.
